# 🌱 Learning App

A simple and calm app that helps you learn something new every day — at your own pace, without pressure.

---

## 🧭 Overview

The **Learning App** is designed to keep you consistent and motivated.  
You can set what you want to learn, track your progress daily, and even pause your streak when needed through “freezes.”  
Everything happens in small, simple steps that make learning feel natural.

## 🎯 Start Learning

Begin by setting your **learning goal** and how long you want to work on it.  
After that, you’ll arrive at your **Activity Page**, where your journey begins.  
From here, you can track your progress and decide each day whether to log it as learned or take a break.

---

## 📘 Logging Progress

Each day, you can mark your progress in one of two ways:

- **Learned Today** – Your streak grows by one, and the current day appears as “learned” on your calendar.  
- **Freeze Day** – When life gets busy, you can freeze a day. Your streak stays safe, and that day appears as “frozen” on your calendar.

This flexibility helps you stay consistent without feeling guilty about taking a day off.

## 🎯 Setting or Continuing Goals

When you complete your current learning goal, you can choose to:
- Start a **new goal** if you want to explore something different.  
- Continue with the **same goal** if you’re not done yet.  

This keeps your progress continuous and meaningful.

## ⚙️ Changing a Goal

You can adjust your **learning goal or duration** anytime from the Activity Page.  
Tap the learning goal icon, make your changes, and continue learning without losing your progress.

## 🗓️ Viewing the Calendar

Your **Calendar** lets you look back at everything you’ve done.  
It shows which days you learned, which ones were frozen, and gives you a clear view of your overall consistency.
